						<h2>Amnesia</h2>
						<p>
							I'm in  a house with no windows<br />
							Only God knows the pain that it carries<br />
							<br />
							These halls are made of prison walls<br />
							In a house not built for suvivors<br />
							<br />
							The inhabitants are scared of receiving<br />
							the kind of torture that could awaken the dead<br />
							<br />
							In the heart of the captor lies the answer<br />
							to their misery<br />
							<br />
							But there's no regret from the source<br />
							why; it is a mystery<br />
							just drink up forget, forget and just like<br />
							that there's no pain left.<br />
							<br />
							Forget the sins of yesterday, those that<br />
							we've washed away<br />
							So we can relive the torture<br />
							<br />
							The sorrow of infinite tomorrow<br />
							Each day feels like new<br />
							Only the captor knew what yesterday had<br />
							held for you<br />
							<br />
							Can you stand the life of despair where<br />
							the truth is in your nightmares<br />
							<br />
							One day the light found a way and shone<br />
							a ray; that was really hope<br />
							<br />
							And I say to the captor<br />
							It's time to take back tomorrow<br />
							You stole the future from the innocent<br />
							Now this is the price you pay<br />
							I take your life away<br />
							<br />
							And this all happened in the light of day.
